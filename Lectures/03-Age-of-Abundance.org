* Recap
- "Public sphere" at a turning point
- Transformation by automated agents and encoded text

** Plan for the day
- *Brief* lecture
- Discussion: how will *you* respond to information abundance?
- Search exercise
- Break
- Website evaluation exercise
- help w/ HTML/CSS/JS (if you're stuck/don't understand) 
* History in the age of scarcity
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The members of prehistoric societies did not think they lived in prehistoric times. They merely lacked a good preservation medium.
#+END_QUOTE
** Scarcity
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear appear appear)
- Historically, very little recorded
- Even less /preserved/
- historian's task was to /locate rare sources/ in faraway places

** Implications
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear appear appear)
- History skewed to /those whose records appeared worth saving/
- record /always/ fragmentary
  - Historian free to fill in gaps
- BUT: often possible to read /large percentage/ of relevant sources

* Age of Abundance
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Tentative efforts are afoot to preserve our digital cultural heritage. If they succeed, historians will face a second, profound challenge–what would it be like to write history when faced by an essentially complete historical record?
#+END_QUOTE

** Abundance
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear appear appear)
- *much* more recorded than in the past
- *vastly more* preserved, at least for now
- increasing percentage of historical works as well

** Mechanical Speech
- auto-preservation
- but by and for whom?

** Problems of Preservation
- physical media
- software turnover & bitrot
- capturing dynamic/interactive media

** What big data means for old documents
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
digitization does provide scale (or quantity) but does so at the price of rich, largely manual encoding. Visualization, customization, personalization, and similar analytical services increasingly familiar to us depend upon born-digital objects in which a great deal of structural and semantic knowledge has been encoded. The information captured on page images is, by contrast, implicit and often not directly accessible to the machines that will be always their first, often their only, and arguably their most important readers.
#+END_QUOTE
** Can we tell stories? Can we do research?
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- no longer possible to read everything!
  - who will read it for us? How will we be experts? can we automate our reading
- Narrative form ill suited to massive quantities of data
  - can we develop new types of narratives?
- Big questions may be answerable!
  - what used to be pure speculation, can perhaps now be made more concrete and compelling
  - How does role of religion in public discourse change over time?
  - how do railroads impact social and economic development?
  - others?
* Openness
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
...ideas that were more-or-less serviceable in the world before networked computers–ideas about value, property rights, communication, creativity, intelligence, governance and many other aspects of society and culture–are now up for debate.  The emergence of new rights regimes (such as *open access, open content and open source*) and the explosion of new information are manifestations of these changing costs.
#+END_QUOTE
** Ideals of openness
- rooted in Enlightenment
- at the foundation of scholarship
- yet, not manifest in our scholarly journals & publishing regimes
** the web as open space
- Origins of Web wrapped up in ideologies of Freedom
- but different freedoms compete
- "walled gardens" vs /open access/
- Struggles only intensifying, with battle lines not quite stable
  - net neutrality
  - the Facebook problem
  - Digital Public Library of America
* Summary
- Information Abundance comes with many challenges
- Preservation
- Interpretation
- Access

Future of the web and of historical scholarship depends on /continued struggle/ over these contested values.
