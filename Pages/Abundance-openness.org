#+TITLE: Abundance, Openness, Choice

During class today, we will perform two group exercises, intended to get you thinking more about information abundance and what it does to historical research; as well as the elements of successful scholarship on the web.  

* Evaluating Websites

Break up into five small groups; I'll assign you each one of the following sites: 

- [[http://www.texasslaveryproject.org/][Texas Slavery Project]], (2007-08)
- [[http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/][History Learning Site]], (2000-15)
- [[http://braceroarchive.org/][Bracero History Archive]], (2008)
- [[http://pendientedemigracion.ucm.es/info/cliwoc/][CLIWOC International]], (2001-03)
- [[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/][British History Online]], (2004-15)

Take 15 minutes to answer the following questions:
- Is this a trustworthy scholarly source?
- In what ways would you need to be cautious when using this site?
- What are the scholarly strengths and weaknesses of the site?
- As a student and a historian, how might you use this site?  As a teacher (if you're a teacher-in-training)?
- In what sense is this an "open" resource? In what senses does it fail to be fully open? 

* Searching
Bring to mind a paper from last term, and an Internet search you used in the course of writing that paper.  Repeat that search using at least 5 of the following search engines -- and please use at least 2 non-google engines!: 
- [[http://www.google.ca][Plain old Google search]]
- [[http://www.google.com/advanced_search][Google Advanced search]]
- [[https://scholar.google.ca/][Google Scholar Advanced Search]] (click on the down-arrow in the search bar to get advanced options)
