* Introduction
We all know -- it is so commonplace that we barely even notice it! -- that we are living through a revolutionary period in the history of communication.  In the year of your birth, the World Wide Web was a scrawny, hand-powered frontier of hand-coded sites and Internet startups.  Amazon and Google were infants.  The University of Toronto Library website [[https://web.archive.org/web/19971210222202/http://library.utoronto.ca/][looked something like this]]:

and many students and faculty still used the card catalog to find books in Robarts.  

Today, the processes of research, writing and reading are all dramatically transformed by information technology.  Instead of painstakingly discovering rare books and manuscript artifacts, we can do full-text searches on a vast corpus.  Our writing is mediated by immensely powerful computing machines, and our creations need not be limited exclusively to the linear texts around which all the humanities initially took shape.  Readers encounter our writing, not as a few precious drops of information in a desert of ignorance, but as part of an endless stream of information that assaults them all day long.  

How should history respond to these new conditions of our existence?  In this class we explore foundational topics in the "[[http://whatisdigitalhumanities.com/][digital]] [[http://digital.humanities.ox.ac.uk/Support/whatarethedh.aspx][humanities]]" and ask what we can learn from them about /how we should be doing history/ -- in particular, how we should be collecting, analyzing, synthesizing and presenting knowledge.  

- How do the digital media developed in the last two decades change the way we understand history? Can the fundamental goal of /interpreting/ the past survive?
- What, if any, new technical skills do we need to acquire?
- Can we use the new media to ask (and answer!) new kinds of questions? Can they help us improve our answers to the old questions?  


* Objectives
At the end of this course, you should:
- be able to describe to others what the phrase "digital humanities" means to you.
- be able to frame a coherent and nuanced argument /of your own/ about the value of DH methods to the field of history
- be able to clearly state and defend a position regarding "engaged scholarship", and articulate the relationship of your argument to the contemporary media landscape
- have a basic understanding of markup languages and their use in DH
- be able to make compelling use of media materials such as audio, video, and animation in historical arguments
- understand how to perform "distant reading" on a corpus of texts
- understand how to create simple historical maps, and have an opinion about the value of GIS in historical argument
* Course Requirements & Grading

The assignments in this course take a wide variety of forms, and for the most part, differ significantly from what you're likely to have encountered in other History courses. If you have little technical experience, or have perhaps ended up in this course by accident (!), you may find some of the work daunting at first. I have done my very best to make the assignments feasible for beginners, but you will likely encounter some difficult moments.  I therefore *strongly* urge you to (1) start early! and (2) persevere through the difficult initial stages.  The frustration you experience is, in fact, part of pedagogiacl method here.  You are not expected to become a coding ninja, but /learning how to learn/ is a major component of work in the Digital Humanities.  

I know there will be questions!  Please don't hesitate to ask them.  And here, finally, is the list of assignments. Detailed assignments will be handed out with adequate time to permit completion.

*** What the Web Signifies <2017-01-13 Fri>
We all live with the web, but that doesn't mean we think much about /how it works/ and /what it's changed/. This week's lecture presents some thoughts on the changing nature of the public sphere and the significance of the web's /digital/ and /machine-readable/ nature.

** Data Driven History
*class drags here a bit, so need to shorten & tighten. No assignment, b/c that tool is difficult to teach with. Maybe modify JS assignment so there is some dta manipulation.*
*** Distant Reading 1 <2017-01-27 Fri>

*Readings:* 
- Stephen Ramsay, "The Hermeneutics of Screwing Around" https://web.archive.org/web/20120611222242/http://www.playingwithhistory.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/hermeneutics.pdf

** Maps, Visualization, and History
*** Spatial History <2017-02-17 Fri>
Contemporary "Historical GIS" and web-based geohistory projects descend from an illustrious lineage of qualitative and quantitative "spatial histories". In class today we explore what happens when "place" takes centre stage in a historical analysis.

*** NO CLASS FEB 24: READING WEEK

*** Visualization <2017-03-03 Fri>
Of course, maps and graphs are in a certain sense part of a much broader field of /rhetorical visualizations:/ attempts to convey quantitative information through pictures in an effort to convince the reader.  

*Readings:*

Maps and visiaulizations are neat and all, but contemporary web-based geohistory allows historical maps to interact powerfully with other data sources.  We'll explore some possibilities!  

*Readings:*

- "The Development, Persistance, and Change of Racial Segregation in U.S. Urban Areas, 1880-2010" in /Spatial Histories/

- Listen to some part of - "I can almost see the lights of home" http://www.albany.edu/jmmh/vol2no1/lightssoundessay.html

*In-Class Activity: Peer interviews* 

*** Oral History & Remix Culture <2017-03-24 Fri>
Once oral histories migrate to the web, they, like maps, can interact with other kinds of data. 

If we're ahead of schedule, we'll watch /Harlan County USA/ in class.  

*Readings:*
