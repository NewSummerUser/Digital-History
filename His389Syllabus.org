We all know -- it is so commonplace that we barely even notice it! -- that we are living through a revolutionary period in the history of communication.  In the year of your birth, the World Wide Web was a scrawny, hand-powered frontier of hand-coded sites and Internet startups.  Amazon and Google were infants.  The University of Toronto Library website [[https://web.archive.org/web/19971210222202/http://library.utoronto.ca/][looked something like this]]:

and many students and faculty still used the card catalog to find books in Robarts.  

Today, the processes of research, writing and reading are all dramatically transformed by information technology.  Instead of painstakingly discovering rare books and manuscript artifacts, we can do full-text searches on a vast corpus.  Our writing is mediated by immensely powerful computing machines, and our creations need not be limited exclusively to the linear texts around which all the humanities initially took shape.  Readers encounter our writing, not as a few precious drops of information in a desert of ignorance, but as part of an endless stream of information that assaults them all day long.  

How should history respond to these new conditions of our existence?  In this class we explore foundational topics in the "[[http://whatisdigitalhumanities.com/][digital]] [[http://digital.humanities.ox.ac.uk/Support/whatarethedh.aspx][humanities]]" and ask what we can learn from them about /how we should be doing history/ -- in particular, how we should be collecting, analyzing, synthesizing and presenting knowledge.  

- How do the digital media developed in the last two decades change the way we understand history? Can the fundamental goal of /interpreting/ the past survive?
- What, if any, new technical skills do we need to acquire?
- Can we use the new media to ask (and answer!) new kinds of questions? Can they help us improve our answers to the old questions?
- Perhaps most powerfully: how do the new digital conditions of existence relate to the question of "engaged" scholarship?  What new opportunities, constraints, and dangers does digital production call forth when we mix scholarship and citizenship?

At the end of this course, you should:
- be able to describe to others what the phrase "digital humanities" means to you.
- be able to frame a coherent and nuanced argument /of your own/ about the value of DH methods to the field of history
- be able to clearly state and defend a position regarding "engaged scholarship", and articulate the relationship of your argument to the contemporary media landscape
- have a basic understanding of markup languages and their use in DH
- be able to make compelling use of media materials such as audio, video, and animation in historical arguments
- understand how to create simple historical maps, and have an opinion about the value of GIS in historical argument

There are many approaches to the digital humanities, all of them involving tools that are under rapid and iterative development.  A given project is likely to require a substantial training period in the particular tools chosen by the principal investigators.  It is therefore not possible for this course to provide an effective survey of "the" digital humanities toolkit. But learning  tools is an essential skill for the digital humanist. So what should we do?

Almost every digital humanist will, at some point, need to do the following:
- read and edit HTML, CSS and Javascript
- debug running web pages using the browser's built-in tools
- use a text editor to write code in any of several languages
- collaborate with peers using version control software, almost always ~git~

Our emphasis is therefore on /simple coding/ taught using /standard tools that are available almost everywhere/.  Almost all of the software we use is Free or Open Source. You will learn very basic web development skills and /slowly/ come to apply them to /increasingly sophisticated/ (but still pretty simple!) historical questions.  These baby steps will give you some sense of what skills a "real" digital history project requires, and give you the tools you'll need to /teach yourself/ when you encounter new tools in the course of a project.  

Please see the [[http://digital.hackinghistory.ca/tools][Tools]] page for more details about the particular tools we will be using.

The assignments in this course take a wide variety of forms, and for the most part, differ significantly from what you're likely to have encountered in other History courses. If you have little technical experience, or have perhaps ended up in this course by accident (!), you may find some of the work daunting at first. I have done my very best to make the assignments feasible for beginners, but you will likely encounter some difficult moments.  I therefore *strongly* urge you to (1) start early! and (2) persevere through the difficult initial stages.  The frustration you experience is, in fact, part of pedagogical method here.  You are not expected to become a coding ninja, but /learning how to learn/ is a major component of work in the Digital Humanities.  

I know there will be questions!  Please don't hesitate to ask them.  And here, finally, is the list of assignments. Detailed assignments will be provided with adequate time to permit completion.

*** COMMENT Text as Data, History as Algorithm <2017-02-10 Fri>

*** Spatial History <2017-02-10 Fri>
