From Frankenstein, by way of Christian apocalyptic, to Star Wars, Star Trek, Battlestar Galactica, and much more, and from the United States to China and back again, the authors who contribute to this volume serve as guides in the exploration of religion and science fiction as a multifaceted, multidisciplinary, and multicultural phenomenon.

This study examines factors that influence an individual's attitude toward pirating digital material. The results of this study suggest that attitude toward digital pirating is influenced by beliefs about the outcome of behavior (cognitive beliefs), happiness and excitement (affective beliefs), age, the perceived importance of the issue, the influence of significant others (subjective norms), and machiavellianism. Given these results, measures can be developed which could alter attitudes toward digital piracy.},

Digitally compressed music files are essentially a perfect public economic good, and illegal copying of these files has increasingly become rampant. In this article, we present a study on the behavioral dynamics that impact the piracy of digital audio files and provide a contrast with software piracy. Our results indicate that the general ethical model of software piracy is broadly applicable to audio piracy. However, significant enough differences with software underscore the unique dynamics of audio piracy. We highlight practical implications that can help the recording industry to effectively combat piracy and provide future research directions.},

  abstract = {Since 2004, I have used various document sets from the National Security Archive (NSA) to teach students about modern Latin American history at Georgia College and State University, a medium-sized public liberal arts university in central Georgia. The NSA has the largest non-governmental online collection of US national security government documents in the world. Its research staff compiles, introduces, contextualizes, analyzes, and sifts through thousands of declassified materials. These include inter-agency memos, embassy communications, executive directives, confidential correspondence, and other once-classified materials. This essay will critically examine the NSA as a way of teaching the histories of US imperialism and intervention, state suppression of popular dissent, militarism, human rights abuses, and counterinsurgency tactics and training in Latin America from the beginning of the Cold War until today. First, I will provide an explanation of the assignments that I use. These consist mostly of document analysis exercises and larger research papers. I will also share which topics students tend to explore, while noting several potential methodological pitfalls in using the NSA documents. Secondly, I will share testimony on how students' views on US foreign policy have changed. The general consensus at the beginning of the semester is that one of the principal aims of US foreign policy is to promote democracy above all other values. After examining the NSA documents, however, students seriously re-examine this idea. Indeed, introducing students to the `raw material' provided by the NSA is a powerful pedagogical tool for delivering and teaching radical history.},

Engagement in gameplay was a complex process of appropriation and resistance, recruiting students' identities and intentions. Learning occurred through recursive cycles of failure and revising strategies, which led to frustration, engagement and learning. Students developed familiarity with game concepts and deeper understandings of relationships among history, geography, economics, and politics.},

During the late 1940s and early 1950s, with theadvent of electronic computing machines, the phrase `computingmachine' gradually gave way simply to `computer',initially usually with the prefix `electronic' or`digital'. This entry surveys the history of thesemachines.},

  shorttitle = {Bridging the {{Divide}}},
  abstract = {This article explores the course objectives, pedagogy, and texts/assignments of the course "Gender, Race and Activism." Learning about the historical traditions of social movements is critical for today's students. They need social justice role models in order to understand what has changed as a result of people's organized and individual efforts over time, and to learn from the successes and challenges of past movements in order to know that change is not only possible but that they, too, can be change agents. When students are exposed to the depth and breadth of activist histories - histories of which they have little to no knowledge - they think more critically about their own education in terms of what stories they have been taught and what/who have been left out. They also become inspired by the successes and challenges of past movements and seek more knowledge, including tools to effectively engage in social activism themselves. Indeed, the underlying premise of the course is to have students make connections between history, theory, and praxis. By instructing students to conduct social justice action projects, the course creates a bridge between historical knowledge and informed activism. The students leave the course more historically informed and better equipped to address present-day challenges. "Gender, Race and Activism" is one requirement of the WILL program at the University of Richmond, which combines coursework in women, gender and sexuality studies with community activism and leadership opportunities for women students.},

  abstract = {Does an increased enthusiasm for publicly engaged scholarship and service learning at many universities translate into a tangible commitment for such projects? How can historians reconcile their participation in public scholarship with trends that promote neoliberal models of university finance and governance, which often put the university at odds with the public outside and inside its walls? In the fall of 2005, a group of history and American Studies PhD students at the University of Minnesota developed a student-created and student-driven seminar titled "Public History and Urban Space." This article explores the results of this innovative seminar and focuses in depth on two student projects that illustrate the opportunities and challenges of publicly engaged graduate scholarship within the neoliberal university. A public history approach to graduate research forces graduate students to rethink assumptions about the nature and political impact of historical research and scholarship while offering a unique opportunity for methodological training unavailable in many other realms of graduate pedagogy. But as seminar participants confronted theoretical and practical issues involved in creating the proposed projects, they also encountered significant challenges to completing the projects as we had envisioned them. In examining the fate of the projects in this self-designed course, this article grapples with the above questions that are at the heart of both the possibilities of public history and its limitations in the contemporary university.},

Social movement groups of a rural and populist nature and traditional voluntary associations encompassing an urban and elitist point of view joined to form the CAAE in 1935, and their conflicting attitudes regarding the role of the Association are traced. External conflicts are discussed, including the changing socio-economic environment of the 1940's; the working relationship between the CAAE, the Canadian Broadcasting Company, and the Canadian Federation of Agriculture regarding broadcasting; and political criticism from the news media. The "National Farm Radio Forum" and "Citizens' Forum" reached sparsely populated rural Canada,  and both programs are described and discussed. Noted figures in the development of the CAAE, CBC, and the Canadian educational and political scene of the day and their roles are examined, including E. A. (Ned) Corbett, James Muir, W. H. Brittain, and J. R. Kidd. Nine chapters present the material, with the 1943 CAAE Manifesto appended and chapter notes and an index provided. (LH)},

  isbn = {978-1-55849-547-0},
  shorttitle = {The {{Lowell Experiment}}},
  abstract = {In the early nineteenth century, Lowell, Massachusetts, was widely studied and emulated as a model for capitalist industrial development. One of the first cities in the United States to experience the ravages of deindustrialization, it was also among the first places in the world to turn to its own industrial and ethnic history as a tool for reinventing itself in the emerging postindustrial economy. The Lowell Experiment explores how history and culture have been used to remake Lowell and how historians have played a crucial yet ambiguous role in that process. The book focuses on Lowell National Historical Park, the flagship project of Lowell's new cultural economy. When it was created in 1978, the park broke new ground with its sweeping reinterpretations of labor, immigrant, and women's history. It served as a test site for the ideas of practitioners in the new field of public history--a field that links the work of professionally trained historians with many different kinds of projects in the public realm. The Lowell Experiment takes an anthropological approach to public history in Lowell, showing it as a complex cultural performance shaped by local memory, the imperatives of economic redevelopment, and tourist rituals--all serving to locate the park's audiences and workers more securely within a changing and uncertain new economy characterized by growing inequalities and new exclusions. The paradoxical dual role of Lowell's public historians as both interpreters of and contributors to that new economy raises important questions about the challenges and limitations facing academically trained scholars in contemporary American culture. As a long-standing and well-known example of"culture-led redevelopment," Lowell offers an outstanding site for exploring questions of concern to those in the fields of public and urban history, urban planning, and tourism studies.},

All good historical practice is reflective, but public history requires a special commitment to collaborate, to respond, to share both inquiry and authority. Because trained practitioners and lay people often seek different pasts for different purposes, public historians may find themselves poised between advocacy and mediation, monitoring and adjusting their own behavior through the process of shared inquiry. Since public history is inherently situational, there is no one-size-fits-all methodology. Drawing on thirty years of shared public history experience, the authors reflect on situations in which they strove to share both inquiry and authority.},

It beings with a discussion of the advantages of using Wikipedia as a teaching tool, an activity that goes beyond a simple addition to the teaching repertoire, and allows contributing to our society through service learning and participation in an online community of practice. Contributing to Wikipedia benefits the students, the instructors and the wider community. 

The second part focuses on practice of teaching with Wikipedia. Building on my five years of experience in teaching with wikis and Wikipedia and holding workshops on the subject, I will discuss the most efficient ways to incorporate Wikipedia into one's teaching curriculum, highlight common problems and their solutions, and describe a number of new tools enhancing the \&ldquo;teaching with Wikipedia\&rdquo; experience.},

Unmoored by institutional expectations, they are what we might call ``outsider history-makers'': genealogists, heritage tourism developers, and re-enactors, among others. They establish emotional connections to the past that operate on the level of instinct more than intellect. As public history professionalizes, the field seems increasingly at odds with this approach. The efforts of the outsiders, however, suggest new strategies for drawing passionate audiences to museums and point to new sets of skills that public history training programs should be teaching their students.},

  abstract = {Democracy in the Digital Age is a fascinating philosophical exploration of how the emerging information and communication technologies are impacting political participation in the United States. Rather than being the antidote to democratic ills, the political conversations occurring online are neither inclusive nor deliberative, suggesting that new technologies, as currently designed and used, are as much threats to progress as they are vehicles of progress. Wilhelm finds that there is often an appearance of progress, but negligible advancement of the human condition. He discusses the four features of digitally-mediated political life (resources, inclusiveness, deliberation, and design) and demonstrates the need for a strong public policy.},

  isbn = {978-1-4529-4057-1},
  shorttitle = {Comparative {{Textual Media}}},
  abstract = {For the past few hundred years, Western cultures have relied on print. When writing was accomplished by a quill pen, inkpot, and paper, it was easy to imagine that writing was nothing more than a means by which writers could transfer their thoughts to readers. The proliferation of technical media in the latter half of the twentieth century has revealed that the relationship between writer and reader is not so simple. From telegraphs and typewriters to wire recorders and a sweeping array of digital computing devices, the complexities of communications technology have made mediality a central concern of the twenty-first century. Despite the attention given to the development of the media landscape, relatively little is being done in our academic institutions to adjust. In Comparative Textual Media, editors N. Katherine Hayles and Jessica Pressman bring together an impressive range of essays from leading scholars to address the issue, among them Matthew Kirschenbaum on archiving in the digital era, Patricia Crain on the connection between a child's formation of self and the possession of a book, and Mark Marino exploring how to read a digital text not for content but for traces of its underlying code. Primarily arguing for seeing print as a medium along with the scroll, electronic literature, and computer games, this volume examines the potential transformations if academic departments embraced a media framework. Ultimately, Comparative Textual Media offers new insights that allow us to understand more deeply the implications of the choices we, and our institutions, are making.

  abstract = {As both technologies and organizations undergo dramatic changes in form and function, organizational researchers are increasingly turning to concepts of innovation, emergence, and improvisation to help explain the new ways of organizing and using technology evident in practice. With a similar intent, I propose an extension to the structurational perspective on technology that develops a practice lens to examine how people, as they interact with a technology in their ongoing practices, enact structures which shape their emergent and situated use of that technology. Viewing the use of technology as a process of enactment enables a deeper understanding of the constitutive role of social practices in the ongoing use and change of technologies in the workplace. After developing this lens, I offer an example of its use in research, and then suggest some implications for the study of technology in organizations.},

  abstract = {In this article, we argue that, just as an edition of a book can be a means of reifying a theory about how books should be edited, so can the creation of an experimental digital prototype be understood as conveying an argument about designing interfaces. Building on this premise, we explore theoretical affinities shared by recent design and book history scholarship, and connect those theories to the emerging practice of peer-reviewing digital objects in scholarly contexts. We suggest a checklist for subjecting prototypes directly to peer review: Is the argument reified by the prototype contestable, defensible, and substantive? Does the prototype have a recognizable position in the context of similar work, either in terms of concept or affordances? Is the prototype part of a series of prototypes with an identifiable trajectory? Does the prototype address possible objections? Is the prototype itself an original contribution to knowledge? We also outline some implications for funding agencies interested in supporting researchers who are designing experimental computer prototypes. For instance, if a series of prototypes functions as a set of smaller arguments within a larger debate, it might be more appropriate to fund the sequence rather than treating each project as an individual proposal.},

~

Also covered are the following:~ What are controlled vocabularies and why are
they useful? Which vocabularies exist for cataloging art and cultural
objects?~ How should they be integrated
in a cataloging system?~ How should they
be used for indexing and for retrieval?~
How should an institution construct a local authority file?~ The links in a controlled vocabulary ensure
that relationships are defined and maintained for both cataloging and
retrieval, clarifying whether a rose
window and a Catherine wheel are
the same thing, or how pot-metal glass
is related to the more general term stained
glass. The book provides organizations and individuals with a practical
tool for creating and implementing vocabularies as reference tools, sources of
documentation, and powerful enhancements for online searching.},
