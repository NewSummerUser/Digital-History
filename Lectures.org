* COMMENT Fixing presentations                                     :noexport:

I need to have live-loading code in these presentations, or I'll run into serious trouble.  
THere are at least three options with reveal, and doubtless otherones using other frameworks.  

** Embed JSBIn
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: embed-jsbin-094f
:END:
gThis is actually pretty simple.  Just extract the jsbin code, and embed it i nan iframe.  Tricky things:
- +instead of a "src" atrribute, you need a "data-src" attribute in the iframe+ actually this was a nload error
- This requires a snippet to add to org -- ideally, this would be a filter that recognizes the jsbin URL and turns it into an iframe (otherwise I'll lose the links in other exports).  Should be a reveal filter, not an html filter
- Has the disadvantage that the code is not actually stored in the org file; but the advantage that html can render directly in the window which is nice.
- would be nice to have a full-screen keystroke or button to take the iframe fullscreen
- no code sample required here b/c it's so simple.

** Use Klipse
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: use-klipse-a813
:END:

actually this works now so I'll do this!!

- klipse is a very, very simple way to embed thecode
- will also likely require an export filter to add the required classes that klipse is looking for.
- unfortunately, also lots of work is required to get klipse/codemirror to display properly in a presentation
- will need lots of css work at a bare minimum. Looks like also some js work
- would be nice to be able to isolate the code div from the rest of the page css. Not sur how to do that. Also probably would be nice to just create an iframe for the code. That would be another option -- have a variable that holds the pre and post code for the iframe and just throw it together
- with iframeswould be nice if the code stayed the same when frame moves off... turns out this is not so hard, just use src instead of data-src.

maybe add jquery, revealeditor, and ace.js as dependencies when loading reveal.js. is that possible?

Note this stuff: 
    <script src="js/jquery.js"></script>
    <script src="revealeditor.js"></script>

So, step one would be to try to load all that stuff as part of the plugin set according to the ox-reveal instructions. If that  doesn't work I can try to just add the html as in [[https://gist.github.com/bzg/5f9a952208cf8d35220a41a8ff857faa#file-gistfile1-txt][Bastien's klipse example]]

The past is the world out of which we have come, the multitude of events and experiences that have shaped our conscious selves and the social worlds we inhabit.

---- HIGHLIGHTS: ---
portion of the public sphere comes into being in every conversation in which private individuals assemble to form a public body.' They then behave neither like business or professional people transacting private affairs, nor like members of a constitutional order subject to the legal constraints of a state bureaucracy. Citizens behave as a public body when they confer in an unrestricted fashion-that is, with the guarantee of freedom of assembly and association and the freedom to express and publish their opinions-about matters of general interest. In a large public body this kind of communication requires specific means for transmitting information and influencing those who receive it. Today newspapers and magazines, radio and television are the media of the public sphere. We speak of the political public sphere in contrast, for instance, to the literary one, when public discussion deals with objects connected to the activity of the state. Although state authority is so to speak the executor of the political public sphere, it is not a part of it.2

The state and the public sphere do not overlap, as one might suppose from casual language use. Rather they confront one another as opponents. Habermas designates that sphere as public which antiquity understood to be private, i.e. the sphere of non-governmental opinion making.

The expression "public opinion" refers to the tasks of criticism and control which a public body of citizens informally-and, in periodic elections, formally as well- practices &-d-vis the ruling structure organized in the form of a state.

It is no coincidence that these concepts of the public sphere and public opinion arose for the first time only in the eighteenth century. They acquire their specific meaning from a concrete historical situation. It was at that time that the distinction of "opinion" from "opinion publique" and "public opinion" came about. Though mere opinions \(cultural assumptions, normative attitudes, collective prejudices and values\) seem to persist unchanged in their natural form as a kind of sediment of history, public opinion can by definition only come into existence when a reasoning public is presupposed. Public discussions about the exercise of political power which are both critical in intent and institutionally guaranteed have not always existed- they grew out of a specific phase of bourgeois society and could enter into the order of the bourgeois constitutional state only as a result of a particular constellation of interests.

By the end of the eighteenth century they had broken apart into private elements on the one hand, and into public on the other. The position of the church changed with the reformation: the link to divine authority which the church represented, that is, religion, became a private matter. So-called religious freedom came to insure what was historically the first area of private autonomy. The church itself continued its existence as one public and legal body among others. The corresponding polarization within princely authority was visibly manifested in the separation of the public budget from the private household expenses of a ruler.

The press remained an institution of the public itself, effective in the manner of a mediator and intensifier of public discussion, no longer a mere organ for the spreading of news but not yet the medium of a consumer culture

Even in the Paris of 1848 every half-way eminent politician organized his club, every other his journal: 450 clubs and over 200 journals were established there between February and May alone. Until the permanent legalization of a politically functional public sphere, the appearance of a political newspaper meant joining the struggle for freedom and public opinion, and thus for the public sphere as a principle. Only with the establishment of the bourgeois constitutional state was the intellectual press relieved of the pressure of its convictions. Since then it has been able to abandon its polemical position and take advantage of the earning possibilities of a commercial undertaking. In England, France, and the United States the transformation from a journalism of conviction to one of commerce began in the 1830s at approximately the same time. In the transition from the literary journalism of private individuals to the public services of the mass media the public sphere was transformed by the influx of private interests, which received special prominence in the mass media.

Because of the diffusion of press and propaganda, the public body expanded beyond the bounds of the bourgeoisie. The public body lost not only its social exclusivity; it lost in addition the coherence created by bourgeois social institutions and a relatively high standard of education. Conflicts hitherto restricted to the private sphere now intrude into the public sphere. Group needs which can expect no satisfaction from a self- regulating market now tend towards a regulation by the state. The public sphere, which must now mediate these demands, becomes a field for the competition of interests, competitions which assume the form of violent conflict. Laws which obviously have come about under the "pressure of the. street" can scarcely still be understood as arising from the consensus of private individuals engaged in public discussion. They correspond in a more or less unconcealed manner to the compromise of conflicting private interests.

With the interweaving of the public and private realm, not only do the political authorities assume certain functions in the sphere of commodity exchange and social labor, but conversely social powers now assume political functions. This leads to a kind of "refeudalization" of the public sphere. Large organizations strive for political compromises with the state and with each other, excluding the public sphere whenever possible. But at the same time the large organizations must assure themselves of at least plebiscitary support from the mass of the population through an apparent display of openness \(demonstrative P~blizitiit\).

The political public sphere of the social welfare state is characterized by a peculiar weakening of its critical functions. At one time the process of making proceedings public \(Publizitdt\) was intended to subject persons or affairs to public reason, and to make political decisions subject to appeal before the court of public opinion.

The idea of the public sphere, preserved in the social welfare state mass democracy, an idea which calls for a rationalization of power through the medium of public discussion among private individuals, threatens to disintegrate with the structural transformation of the public sphere itself. It could only be realized today, on an altered basis, as a rational reorganization of social and political power under the mutual control of rival organizations committed to the public sphere in their internal structure as well as in their relations with the state and each other.

Here is a step toward a working definition. Digital history is an approach to examining and representing the past that works with the new communication technologies of the computer, the Internet network, and software systems. On one level, digital history is an open arena of scholarly production and communication, encompassing the development of new course materials and scholarly data collections. On another, it is a methodological approach framed by the hypertextual power of these technologies to make, define, query, and annotate associations in the human record of the past. To do digital history, then, is to create a framework, an ontology, through the technology for people to experience, read, and follow an argument about a historical problem.



Digital history possesses a crucial set of common components—the capacity for play, manipulation, participation, and investigation by the reader. Dissemination in digital form makes the work of the scholar available for verification and examination; it also offers the reader the opportunity to experiment. He or she can test the interpretations of others, formulate new views, and mine the materials of the past for overlooked items and clues. The reader can immerse him/herself in the past, surrounded with the evidence, and make new associations. The goal of digital history might be to build environments that pull readers in less by the force of a linear argument than by the experience of total immersion and the curiosity to build connections. (Versus the narrative anticipation of what comes next, this is a curiosity about what could be related to what and why.)

Digital sources

• Can be created and altered with relatively little effort or expense

• Can be duplicated with near-zero marginal cost and shared by any number of people

• Can be transmitted near or at the speed of light

• Can be stored in nanoscale volumes

• Can serve as the inputs to any process that can be specified algorithmically

• Allow form to be more easily separated from content

• Allow historians to gain the well-known benefits of working in a networked mode

The use of digital sources, in other words, completely changes the landscape of information and transaction costs that historians have traditionally faced.

 Their main concern was audience and access. We heard a great deal about “democratizing history” and opening the archives to wider dissemination. Many historians welcomed the Web largely because of the opportunity to expand the audience for historical scholarship. 

Some historians have tried to reconcile the iterative, seemingly stable, process of analog historical scholarship with the digital environment. Most of all, we have struggled with the question: Where does interpretation go in these online projects? Ideas about versioning, release dates, update systems, and so forth, bubbled to the surface in technical meetings for many projects. Interpretation, the coin of the realm in professional historical study, seemed cast aside How could interpretation be assessed if the project was continually in motion? Most digital history projects offered huge audiences, but potentially at the expense of interpretive salience. Was the digital medium the place to do historical scholarship? Or was it suitable only for pedagogical tool building? Or documentary editing? 

ew Archives/New Inquiry: Digital resources are expanding and redefining the archival base for most fields and thereby redefining the fields themselves. (This is driven more by libraries and the tech industry than by historians.) My initial interest in things digital grew from developing a database to piece together fragmentary sources obscure people had left behind in multiple archives; the approach was not new, but the scale of the project I could imagine as an individual graduate student was. Linda Colley’s latest book, The Ordeal of Elizabeth Marsh—trumpeted in reviews as a “new” approach to biography—is a recent example. The book is not new in its recovery of an ordinary life as a window on a world. (Laurel Thatcher Ulrich showed us that in 1990.) But its ability to encompass the globe is new; Colley credits new media resources with making the project possible.

Audience: New bridges between academic and popular/public history.

Collaboration: A source of excitement and perhaps peril. The best digital projects are collaborative, involving multiple scholars and a technical team, and ideally an institution committed to keeping the project alive after its creators move on to other things. This is, I think, a great way to work. It is not, however, one for which history as a discipline has established institutional resources. 

To reiterate some of the excellent points made here: The new media are profoundly changing the ways most historians work, whether or not we are self-conscious about how we are becoming digital. As Dan has noted, it is in the discipline’s interest to be proactive, rather than reactive, in response to these changes. Institutions and individuals who have steered clear of the cutting edge have an important role to play here. Even those who do not envision themselves shaping new tools or expressive forms can—and should—work to make sure that the rising generation of scholars has the opportunity and the institutional space to experiment with digital media. In addition to funding and professionally sanctioned forums for expression, there needs be space for this in the graduate curriculum. The digital pioneers present in this conversation—and the much-missed Roy Rosenzweig—have made it very easy for others to introduce themselves and their students to the field. Check out their online syllabi; you might well be able to add an “Introduction to History and the New Media” to your institution’s roster of methods courses.

By "the public sphere" we mean... a realm of our social life in which something approaching public opinion can be formed... *Citizens behave as a public body when they confer in an unrestricted fashion* -- that is, with the guarantee of freedom of assembly and association and the freedom to express and publish their opinions -- *about matters of general interest.* (Habermas 1964, p.49[p.2])

digitization does provide scale (or quantity) but does so at the price of rich, largely manual encoding. Visualization, customization, personalization, and similar analytical services increasingly familiar to us depend upon born-digital objects in which a great deal of structural and semantic knowledge has been encoded. The information captured on page images is, by contrast, implicit and often not directly accessible to the machines that will be always their first, often their only, and arguably their most important readers.

The Party said that Oceania had never been in alliance with Eurasia. He, Winston Smith, knew that Oceania had been in alliance with Eurasia as short a time as four years ago. But where did that knowledge exist? Only in his own consciousness, which in any case must soon be annihilated. And if all others accepted the lie which the Party imposed -if all records told the same tale -- then the lie passed into history and became truth. 'Who controls the past,' ran the Party slogan, 'controls the future: who controls the present controls the past.' And yet the past, though of its nature alterable, never had been altered. Whatever was true now was true from everlasting to everlasting. It was quite simple. All that was needed was an unending series of victories over your own memory. 'Reality control', they called it: in Newspeak, 'doublethink'.

...

Winston sank his arms to his sides and slowly refilled his lungs with air. His mind slid away into the labyrinthine world of doublethink. To know and not to know, to be conscious of complete truthfulness while telling carefully constructed lies, to hold simultaneously two opinions which cancelled out, knowing them to be contradictory and believing in both of them, to use logic against logic, to repudiate morality while laying claim to it, to believe that democracy was impossible and that the Party was the guardian of democracy, to forget whatever it was necessary to forget, then to draw it back into memory again at the moment when it was needed, and then promptly to forget it again: and above all, to apply the same process to the process itself. That was the ultimate subtlety: consciously to induce unconsciousness, and then, once again, to become unconscious of the act of hypnosis you had just performed. Even to understand the word 'doublethink' involved the use of doublethink.

 It would be curious then, if an idea, the fugitive fermentation of an individual brain, could, of natural right, be claimed in exclusive and stable property. If nature has made any one thing less susceptible than all others of exclusive property, it is the action of the thinking power called an idea, which an individual may exclusively possess as long as he keeps it to himself; but *the moment it is divulged, it forces itself into the possession of every one,* and the receiver cannot dispossess himself of it. Its peculiar character, too, is that no one possesses the less, because every other possesses the whole of it. He who receives an idea from me, receives instruction himself without lessening mine; as he who lights his taper at mine, receives light without darkening me. *That ideas should freely spread from one to another over the globe, for the moral and mutual instruction of man, and improvement of his condition, seems to have been peculiarly and benevolently designed by nature, when she made them,* like fire, expansible over all space, without lessening their density in any point, and like the air in which we breathe, move, and have our physical being, incapable of confinement or exclusive appropriation. Inventions then cannot, in nature, be a subject of property.

When you look at a CSS file, you will see it is divided into a bunch of stanzas, like this.  Each of these stanzas is called a "selector statement":
They all follow the same pattern: 
- first, a *selector* that identifies the elements to which these instructions will apply
- then *an open brace* "{" which marks the start of the actual instructions
- then a series of *property-value pairs*.  Each of these sets the /value/ of a particular /property/ (duh).  Note that at the end of a property, there is *always* a semi-colon!  
- finally, *a closing brace* that ends the selector declaration.

Though simple in principle, CSS selectors can be confusing.  Here are some basic selector types:
- *Element* selectors:  these just give the element (like h1, p, div, span, etc.).  they apply to all elements of this type.
- *Class* selectors:  these give the name of a class attribute that an HTML element may have.  This selector will always begin with a period (".").  So for instance:

- *ID* selector:  this addresses the element with a particular ID:

*** Box Model
One important notion to understand in CSS is the so-called "[[http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/box.html][Box Model]]", which accounts for the distribution of whitespace around elements.  A lot of the grief you will encounter when designing websites will come back to the box model, so it's important to learn it:

2. use the new "box-sizing:border-box" attribute.  This will do all the math for you.

*** Positioning

This is a difficult subject.  When you are dealing with lots of different screen sizes and resolutions, and different devices with different fonts installed, etc., it is not trivial to position every element precisely where you want it.  You will find a lot of your teeth-gnashing time is spent trying to get various columns of content to line up pretty, center themselves, etc.  

The CSS "position" property has four possible values, whose names are [[http://learnlayout.com/position.html][impossible to remember and anyway don't make sense]].  The four most important are:

#+BEGIN_SRC css
.static {
  position: static;
}
.relative1 {
  position: relative;
}
.relative2 {
  position: relative;
  top: -20px;
  left: 20px;
  background-color: white;
  width: 500px;
}
.fixed {
  position: fixed;
  bottom: 0;
  right: 0;
  width: 200px;
  background-color: white;
}
.absolute {
  position: absolute;
  top: 120px;
  right: 0;
  width: 300px;
  height: 200px;
}
#+END_SRC

- *Static* positioning is the default.  A statically-positioned element is said to be "unpositioned".
- *Relatively* positioned elements are displaced /relative/ to the position they "ought" to be occupying (according to the defaults).  But meanwhile, the space it "ought" to be occupying is still considered "taken" by the browser, which won't put anything else in that space unless you force it to do so.
- *fixed* elements have their position /fixed/ to a spot on the screen (which is called "the viewport" in CSS talk).  This is great when you want a fixed header or footer.
- *absolutely*-positioned elements are like fixed elements, only they're positioned relative to the /closest positioned ancestor/, usually an element with a position property value of "relative".

Understanding this well involves fiddling a lot with code; rather than make a bunch of fiddly exercies myself, I'll direct you [[http://www.codecademy.com/courses/web-beginner-en-6merh/3/1?curriculum_id=50579fb998b470000202dc8b][the codeacademy positioning exercies]], which have a great help system that makes things a little easier.

*** Positioning 2: Float
So, that's one way to position elements.  Another is to use the *float* property, which imagines the page flowing like water.  The element will "float" left or right, and everything else will /flow around it/.  To stop the flowing -- that is, to require the next element to appear *below* a floated element -- that next element will need to apply the *clear* property, which stops the float.

Let's play around with this briefly [[http://jsbin.com/dakedo/1/edit?html,css,output][in JSBin]].  

*** Changes Comin' Round Real Soon
All of what you just learned is in the process of changing dramatically.  A new CSS module, *[[https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/][flexbox]]*, makes a lot of this stuff much easier, but takes some practice to understand.

[[http://jsbin.com/yukiwe/3/edit?html,css][Here]] is a very quick introduction to flexbox.

Meanwhile, there are lots of other new CSS features coming along, which will be supported by more and more browsers as we move forwards.

Rosenzweig, abundance
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Ignacio's sudden deletion of Bert should capture our interest as historians since it dramatically illustrates the fragility of evidence in the digital era. If Ignacio had published his satire in a book or magazine, it would sit on thousands of library shelves rather than having a more fugitive existence as magnetic impulses on a web server. Although some historians might object that the Bert Is Evil web site is of little historical significance, even traditional historians should worry about what the digital era might mean for the historical record. U.S. government records, for example, are being lost on a daily basis. Although most government agencies started using e-mail and word processing in the mid-1980s, the National Archives still does not require that digital records be retained in that form, and governmental employees profess confusion over whether they should be preserving electronic files.3 Future historians may be unable to ascertain not only whether Bert is evil, but also which undersecretaries of defense were evil, or at least favored the concepts of the "evil empire" or the "axis of evil." Not only are ephemera like "Bert" and government records made vulnerable by digitization, but so are traditional works–books, journals, and film–that are increasingly being born digitally. As yet, no one has figured out how to ensure that the digital present will be available to the future's historians.

But, as we shall see, tentative efforts are afoot to preserve our digital cultural heritage. If they succeed, historians will face a second, profound challenge–what would it be like to write history when faced by an essentially complete historical record? In fact, the Bert Is Evil story could be used to tell a very different tale about the promiscuity and even persistence of digital materials. After all, despite Ignacio's pleas and Children's Television Workshop's threats, a number of Bert "mirror" sites persist. Even more remarkably, the Internet Archive–a private organization that began archiving the web in 1996–has copies of Bert Is Evil going back to March 30, 1997.

The struggle to incorporate the possibilities of new technology into the ancient practice of history has led, most importantly, to questioning the basic goals and methods of our craft. For example, the Internet has dramatically expanded and, hence, blurred our audiences. A scholarly journal like this one is suddenly much more accessible to high school students and history enthusiasts. And the work of history buffs is similarly more visible and accessible to scholars. We are forced, as a result, to rethink who our audiences really are. Similarly, the capaciousness of digital media means that the page limits of journals like this one are no longer fixed by paper and ink costs. As a result, we are led to question the nature and purpose of the scholarly journals–why do they publish articles with particular lengths and structures? Why do they publish particular types of articles? The simultaneous fragility and promiscuity of digital data requires yet more rethinking–about whether we should be trying to save everything, who is "responsible" for preserving the past, and how we find and define historical evidence.

But much–really, most–of the record of previous historical eras has disappeared. "The members of prehistoric societies did not think they lived in prehistoric times," Washington Post writer Joel Achenbach observes. "They merely lacked a good preservation medium." And non-digital records that have survived into this century–from Greek and Chinese antiquities to New Guinean folk traditions to Hollywood films–are also seriously threatened.9

Print books and records decline slowly and unevenly–faded ink or a broken-off corner of a page. But digital records fail completely–a single damaged bit can render an entire document unreadable. Here is the key difference from the paper era: we need to take action now because digital items very quickly become unreadable, or recoverable only at great expense.

But the medium is far from the weakest link in the digital preservation chain. Well before most digital media degrade, they are likely to become unreadable because of changes in hardware (the disk or tape drives become obsolete) or software (the data are organized in a format destined for an application program that no longer works). The life expectancy of digital media may be as little as ten years, but very few hardware platforms or software programs last that long.

The problem is still worse because of the ability of digital media to create and represent complex, dynamic, and interactive objects–another of their great virtues. Even relatively simple documents that appear to have direct print analogs turn out to be more complex. Printing out e-mail messages makes rapid searches of them impossible and often jettisons crucial links to related messages and attachments.

. But digital information–because it is so easily altered and copied, lacks physical marks of its origins, and, indeed, even the clear notion of an "original"–cannot be authenticated as physical documents and objects can. We have, for example, no way of knowing that forwarded e-mail messages we receive daily have not been altered. In fact, the public archive of Usenet discussion groups contains hundreds of deliberately and falsely attributed messages. "Fakery," write David Bearman and Jennifer Trant, "has not been a major issue for most researchers in the past, both because of the technical barriers to making plausible forgeries, and because of the difficulty with which such fakes entered an authoritative information stream."14 Digital media, tools, and networks have altered the balance.

But this "system" will not work in the digital era because preservation cannot begin twenty-five years after the fact. What might happen, for example, to the records of a writer active in the 1980s who dies in 2003 after a long illness? Her heirs will find a pile of unreadable 5 1/4" floppy disks with copies of letters and poems written in WordStar for the CP/M operating system or one of the more than fifty now-forgotten word-processing programs used in the late 1980s.23

Thus the Internet Archive is very far from the complete solution to the problem of digital preservation. It does not deal with the digital records that vex the National Archives and other repositories because they lack the public accessibility and minimal standardization in HTML of web pages. Nor does it include much formally published literature–e-books and journals–which is sold and hence gated from view. And even for what it has gathered, it has not yet hatched a long-term preservation plan, which would have to incorporate a strategy for continuing access to digital data that are in particular (and time-bound) formats. 

If historians are to set themselves "against forgetting" (in Milan Kundera's resonant phrase), then they may need to figure out new ways to sort their way through the potentially overwhelming digital record of the past. Contemporary historians are already groaning under the weight of their sources. Robert Caro has spent twenty-six years working his way through just the documents on Lyndon B. Johnson's pre-vice-presidential years–including 2,082 boxes of Senate papers. Surely, the injunction of traditional historians to look at "everything" cannot survive in a digital era in which "everything" has survived.55

f historians are going to join in preservation discussions, they will have to make themselves better informed about the simultaneous abundance of historical sources and scarcity of financial resources that lead archivists and librarians to respond with exasperation to scholars' blithe insistence that everything must be saved.

 When Shirley Baker, president of the Association of Research Libraries, challenged historian Robert Darnton's favorable review of Baker's book and noted "choices have always had to be made" in the absence of "greater public commitment to the preservation of the historical record," Darnton responded by urging the establishment of "a new kind of national library dedicated to the preservation of cultural artifacts" (including disappearing digital records) and funded by income generated by the sale or rental of bandwidth.65

 Electronic digital information can be duplicated at near-zero cost, transmitted at the speed of light, stored in infinitesimally small volumes, and created, processed and consumed by machines.  This means that ideas that were more-or-less serviceable in the world before networked computers–ideas about value, property rights, communication, creativity, intelligence, governance and many other aspects of society and culture–are now up for debate.  The emergence of new rights regimes (such as open access, open content and open source) and the explosion of new information are manifestations of these changing costs.

You won’t be able to read everything.  Estimates of the amount of new information that is now created annually are staggering (2003, 2009).  As you become more skilled at finding online sources, you will discover that new material on your topic appears online much faster than you can read it.  The longer you work on something, the more behind you will get.  This is OK, because everyone faces this issue whether they realize it or not.  In traditional scholarship, scarcity was the problem: travel to archives was expensive, access to elite libraries was gated, resources were difficult to find, and so on.  In digital scholarship, abundance is the problem.  What is worth your attention or your trust?

Assume that what you want is out there, and that you simply need to locate it.

---- HIGHLIGHTS: ---

But when the dirty OCR was paired with the page images, the value of the technique became greatly enhanced because the text was considered good enough for searching, and potentially ambiguous results could be compared with the page image, which was considered authoritative. This strategy of linking page images with OCR enables us to make effective use of large corpora of relatively cheaply scanned books and was, in large measure, effective because it points backwards to the limitations of print: search gets human readers to the page and leaves them to parse out its meaning.

In short, digitization does provide scale \(or quantity\) but does so at the price of rich, largely manual encoding. Visualization, customization, personalization, and similar analytical services increasingly familiar to us depend upon born-digital objects in which a great deal of structural and semantic knowledge has been encoded. The information captured on page images is, by contrast, implicit and often not directly accessible to the machines that will be always their first, often their only, and arguably their most important readers. So given the trade-off between scale and encoding in converted text corpora, what are our options, and where are the opportunities?

Very large collections based on image books differ from first-generation
digital collections by one or more orders of magnitude. Of course, they
are much larger: one internal estimate of Google’s collection in spring
2007 suggested that their searches were scanning at least 2 million
books already. At the same time, these collections are much more
heterogeneous, with books from any library shelf likely to find their way
into the scanning workflow. The range of subjects is thus far broader than
in the curated collections to which we are accustomed. The range of
subjects means that error rates will be much more variable, with OCR of
many texts in non-standard scripts (e.g., Arabic, Classical Greek)
producing little or no searchable text.

Linguistics. Automatically track patterns in morphology, syntax, and semantics across large stretches of time, space, and culture. These studies might be synchronic

Intellectual history. Dan Cohen, assistant professor in the Department of History and Art History at George Mason University, pointed out that the secularization thesis, for example, states that the role of religion declined in general discourse during the 19th century, but most studies of this topic have been anecdotal. If we could track references to the Bible or to other religious terminology across thousands of texts, we could begin to put this thesis on more solid footing.


Social and economic history. Will Thomas, professor of history at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, pointed out the implications of very large collections for the study of broad socioeconomic topics such as the influence of railroads in U.S. history. Researchers can mine very large collections for references to, and propositional statements about, railroads to trace their development during the 19th century.

This faculty member faces two fundamental challenges: understanding and then communicating with intellectual communities that have different assumed background knowledge, different ideas of what questions are and are not important, different conventions of argumentation, and so on.


. We need to provide not only accurate keystrokes but also semantic markup.




Raw OCR output from page images with human-curated book-level metadata is the starting point for all work. Automatically generated metadata, capturing structural elements \(e.g., tables of contents, chapters/sections, footnotes, marginalia, indices\) will be sufficient for many purposes.

Curated structural metadata. If we have carefully marked the headwords of a reference work such as the Encyclopedia Britannica 13th edition, we can then use the OCR-generated text for each article to train classifiers to distinguish references to various Springfields or Washingtons in unstructured text.


So, this workshop posed one big question: How does scale in content, made possible by mass digitization, change humanities research? As a result of the discussion, we can now pose five questions that parse this broad question into more manageable topics for research:

\) How do traditional archival values migrate into the computationally intensive environment made possible by copious digital data and digital tools?

2\) When only the computer actually "reads" the object or the text, a new and not fully understood relationship is created among author, tools,

objects, and readers \(or users\)


Recognition of the value of the digital research and its expression in digital form, even if that expression is subject to ongoing change by subsequent generations of scholar

Recognition of digital scholarship that focuses on infrastructure. Classicists spent centuries creating the critical editions, lexica, grammars, encyclopedias, commentaries, and technical studies on which twentieth-century scholarship largely depended. We now need machine-actionable knowledge bases that can serve advanced systems and human researchers alike. These knowledge bases have print antecedents but the need to represent them in machine- actionable form and to support complex services may ultimately render them qualitatively different from their print predecessors. We need in the humanities as in the sciences to attract and support some of our most promising scholars to bridge the gap between the needs, present and potential, of the humanities and the possibilities enabled by scholarship.


Finding ways to provide analytical access the Open Content book data now available should be a priority. Scholars should be able to pose questions that analyze very large collections: e.g., what passages from Shakespeare or the Bible appear in different genres over time?

should apply exemplary questions to open collections such as the OCA, access functions that Google, Microsoft, and others provide to end-user services and APIs.

e need to clarify the costs and benefits of book scanning vs. the intensive transcription and markup of complex knowledge sources. We cannot afford to apply human labor and expertise directly to more than a tiny percentage of the published record of humanity. Are there printed materials that would, if carefully converted into machine actionable form, uniquely enhance our ability to analyze relatively unbounded bodies of

We need to understand more clearly how to relate high- value, domain-specific services and data structures to services and data structures that are common to all collections. Every discipline needs text searches, but some communities need different kinds of search.

 Dorothea, endowed with the extraordinary capacity for attentiveness that is “ardor,” is given to the strongest denunciations of the trivial, the most overwhelming anxieties of admitting the trivial into her life of any character in the novel. She is blind to the possibility that attention has the capacity to reveal that what seems trivial is in fact significant. She fears instead that the attention is wasted by devoting itself to those common objects which really are trivial, which have no redeeming significance: 

"“I should learn everything then,” she said to herself, still walking quickly along the bridle road through the wood. “It would be my duty to study that I might help him the better in his great works. There would be nothing trivial about our lives. Everyday-things with us would mean the greatest things."

If the pharmakon is ‘ambivalent,’ it is because it constitutes the medium in which opposites are opposed, the movement and the play that links them among themselves, reverses them or makes one side cross over into the other (soul/ body, good/ evil, inside/ outside, memory/ forgetfulness, speech/ writing, etc.).…The pharmakon is the movement, the locus, and the play: (the production of) difference. It is the différance of difference. It holds in reserve, in its undecided shadow and vigil, the opposites and the differends that the process of discrimination will come to carve out. Contradictions and pairs of opposites are lifted from the bottom of this diacritical, differing, deferring, reserve. Already inhabited by différance, this reserve, even though it ‘precedes’ the opposition between different effects, even though it preexists differences as effects, does not have the punctual simplicity of a coincidentia oppositorum. It is from this fund that dialectics draws its reserves

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
    The gist of textexure’s process is that account of words that occur near each other. That is not to say words have to be directly next to one another, paragraph and sentence structures are both considered. In the network, the nodes are the words themselves while the edges (or connections from node to node) are determined by the co-occurrence between words either directly, in paragraphs or sentences. In terms of the visualization, this effectively does two things: 1. organizes groups of words into the communities they appear (color coded) so that with a quick glance at the network, you can pick out certain themes and 2. You can also easily see what the primary theme that links the various aspects together.
#+END_QUOTE
In short, Textexture tries to automatically discern and visualize relationships between words, based on their usage, within a text. Looking at the network graph of your novel, what relationships seem most interesting? Experiment with the graph by clicking through different words.

    #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     It is not really we who address the texts of tradition, but the canonic texts that address us. Having traveled through decades and centuries, the classic works of art, literature, science, and philosophy question us and our way of life. Our prejudices, whatever aspects of our cultural horizon that we take for granted, are brought into the open in the encounter with the past.
    #+END_QUOTE
#+BEGIN_NOTES
 Human being, Gadamer argues, is a being in language. It is through language that the world is opened up for us. We learn to know the world by learning to master a language. Hence we cannot really understand ourselves unless we understand ourselves as situated in a linguistically mediated, historical culture. Language is our second nature

 Gadamer argues that we never know a historical work as it originally appeared to its contemporaries. We have no access to its original context of production or to the intentions of its author. Tradition is always alive. It is not passive and stifling, but productive and in constant development. Trying, as the earlier hermeneuticians did, to locate the (scientific) value of the humanities in their capacity for objective reconstruction is bound to be a wasted effort. The past is handed over to us through the complex and ever-changing fabric of interpretations, which gets richer and more complex as decades and centuries pass. History, as Gadamer puts it, is always effective history. This, however, is not a deficiency. It is, rather, a unique possibility, a possibility that involves the particular kind of truth-claim that Gadamer ascribes to the human sciences: the truth of self-understanding.

  I walk into the library and wander around in a state of insoucient boredom. I like music, so I head over to the music section. I pick up a book on American rock music and start flipping through it (because it’s purple and big). There’s an interesting bit on Frank Zappa, and it mentions that Zappa was way into this guy named Edgard Varèse. I have no idea who that is, so I start looking around for some Varèse. One look at the cover of his biography—Varèse with that mad-scientist look and the crazy hair—and I’m already a fan. And so off I go. I check out some records and discover Varèse.

Today in class we are discussing /spatial history/, that is, history which focusses very strongly on the cultural history of space and place. There is nothing /intrinsically digital/ about spatial history, nor is it necessarily qunatitative in nature; but the incredible development of Geographical Information Systems (GIS) in the last 15 years has made the use of interactive digital maps an attractive target for historians.

Sophisticated works such as the [[http://web.stanford.edu/group/spatialhistory/cgi-bin/site/pub.php?id=29][Spatial History Project]] and Ben Schmidt's [[http://sappingattention.blogspot.co.uk/2012/10/data-narratives-and-structural.html][Whaling Maps Project]] take substantial technical effort to achieve their effects; in general, lengthy training in the use of specialized GIS software is required. We have our own example in the [[http://decima.chass.utoronto.ca/][DECIMA Project]] run by Prof. Terpstra in our department.

Our approach will be decidedly more lightweight. In class today, we will build a very simple "Geographical Information System" around a Google Map. Google Maps are, in fact, highly sophisticated GIS's, with powerful tools for accessing various layers of information; but in order to work with them, we will need to use a very small amount of Javascript.

If you want to work locally, I strongly recommend both the [[https://atom.io/][Atom Code Editor]], and [[http://brackets.io/][Brackets]]; many people also like [[https://www.sublimetext.com/3][Sublime Text]], though you ought to buy a license for Sublime if you continue to use it.  Brackets and Atom both also show a live preview of your code, almost like JSBin (For Atom you will have to [[https://atom.io/docs/latest/using-atom-atom-packages][install]] the atom-html-preview package, while Brackets comes with a live preview in Chrome, which can be activated with ~Ctrl-Alt- you will get live updates of your code in a second tab, almost like in jsbin.

*** What is a GIS?
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: what-is-a-gis?-12ec
:END:

GIS is just a name for any system that tries to capture, manipulate, and represent geographical data. There are many GIS tools; the history department uses [[http://www.arcgis.com/features/][ArcGIS]], which is expensive and something of an industry standard, while many independent scholars use [[http://www.qgis.org/en/site/][QGIS]], which is free, open source, and not quite as powerful as Arc.

The data in a GIS is all [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geotagging][geotagged]], that is, assigned a set of geographical co-ordinates. This sounds simple but it is actually quite complex, since any co-ordinate system is a /simplified projection/ of real, disordered, 3-dimensional space.  Many of the frustrations of working with GIS comes from the difficulty of rendering (say) historical map images /commensurate/ with modern, satellite-derived maps.

Within a GIS, information is generally accessed as a set of *layers*.  Data of specific types is /stratified/ in layers, in much the same way that one creates image layers in photoshop. This image gives a typical example.  Note that the creation of layers is itself an intellectual decision, relying on judgments about the relationships between individual bits of data.

*** Controlling Google Maps
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: controlling-google-maps-a206
:END:
For our exercise today, we are really only interested in two layers:  the "basemap", that is, the street or satellite map most of us use on an almost-daily basis; and the /marker layer/, in which all of the little pins on a map are stored.  We access these layers, and create those markers, with Javascript, by making /calls/ to the /Google Maps API/.

#+BEGIN_ASIDE
An *API* is an "Application Programming Interface": a communications channel that lets programs talk to each other.  By "loading" the Google Maps API, our web pages can communicate directly with Google's servers to modify the map that Google is presenting to us.  In fact, most of the interesting stuff happening on the web these days happens via these machine-to-machine communication channels.  
#+END_ASIDE


You don't have to understand the Google Maps API very thoroughly to be able to do this assignment.  The code comes pre-written; all you have to do is hack at it till it does what you want it to.  

*** Using Markdown (refresher)
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: using-markdown-3d00
:END:
It was useful to learn HTML but it is a pain to generate it by hand. You do have to do some hand-coding of HTML for this exercise, because some of the work actually happens in Javascript; but the rest of it can be done in markdown, which I find much easier to write than HTML. 

#+BEGIN_SRC markdown
# one or more '#' marks indicates a headline

### this one is "level 3"

*a single asterisk is emphasis, or italics*

**two are strong, or bold**

An empty line separates paragraphs.

> blockquotes are made with angle brackets
> like this

#+END_SRC

You can also mix HTML in with markdown and it will generally render perfectly well. This is important for us because we have to create some ~<div>~ elements, which markdown can't do for us.

While you're coding, reflect on [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8gGsuWouDE&t=0m20s][the satisfaction that good, honest work brings to the act of electronic communication]]. 

*** The Exercise
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: the-exercise-9a2b
:END:
Today you will create a web page containing a Google Map.  The Google Map will contain 1-3 markers.  It will also contain a VERY brief essay that discusses the historical significance of the events represented by those markers, all the while paying homage to the project of spatial history: foregrounding the spatial elements of the historical narrative at hand.  You're not handing in your work, so don't fret too much.  Try to enjoy yourself; but also work hard, as this is good preparation for our next assignment, which wil lbe handed out in class on Thursday. 

*** The code
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: the-code-e630
:END:
**** Javascript
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: javascript-ed67
:END:
I have made the Javascript as simple as I can. There are more efficient and interesting ways to do this, but they are a little more complex. To make your markers -- and to re-centre your map -- you will need to modify the Javascript directly.
**** HTML
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: html-f31e
:END:
I /think/ the only modifications you will need to make to the HTML are within the special "textarea" block containing the markdown syntax.  The rest you can probably safely ignore, though you might learn something from looking at it.
**** CSS
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: css-46fc
:END:
The CSS for this exercise is deceptively simple.  We make only a few small changes tothe defaults, /but/ we are cheating here.  The [[http://strapdownjs.com/][strapdown]] javascript library which enables us to magically write using markdown, /also/ magically loads the incredible [[http://getbootstrap.com/][bootstrap]] web development framework, which includes some sophisticated CSS.  Try changing the first ~textarea~'s ~theme=united~ to one of the other supported "swatches" -- I'm a fan of "cyborg" and "slate", myself.

#+BEGIN_NOTES
CJ Minard (1781-1870); civil engineer; drawn in 1869; 
 six different dimensions: latitude, longitude, direction of movement, time, temperature, and the size of the Grand Army. Minard’s achievement here is expertly illustrating a complex, multivariate time-space story in a compelling and concise display. Tufte has famously endorsed it as the “best statistical graphic ever drawn.” 11  E.J. Marey, a contemporary of Minard, praised the map as “seeming to defy the pen of the historian by its brutal eloquence.” 1

"The numbers of men present are represented by the widths of the colored zones in a rate of one millimeter for ten thousand men; these are also written beside the zones. Red designates men moving into Russia, black those on retreat. — The informations used for drawing the map were taken from the works of Messrs. Thiers, de Ségur, de Fezensac, de Chambray and the unpublished diary of Jacob, pharmacist of the Army since 28 October.
In order to facilitate the judgement of the eye regarding the diminution of the army, I supposed that the troops under Prince Jèrôme and under Marshal Davoust, who were sent to Minsk and Mobilow and who rejoined near Orscha and Witebsk, had always marched with the army."

#+END_QUOTE 
#+BEGIN_NOTES

critics contend that GIS privileges master narratives and cat-
egorical causation at the cost of contingent causation and
alternative interpretations and renderings of space and par-
ticularly place. This reductionist meta-narrative stands in con-
trast to many parts of human geography and the humanities
that are heavily versed in multivocality, intertextuality, and
contingency, and where place is as equally important as
space in the construction of human geographies. (http://www.tandfonline.com.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/doi/pdf/10.1080/00087041.2016.1243864?needAccess=true

maps on their own are not "stories". But on the other hand *places* are essential to stories. cf. finding that tellers of oral epics memorize their stories *place by place* -- places have strong resonances within our narratives. So, can we capture place in a more robust way?

The first thing that makes oral history different, therefore, is that it tells us
less about events than about their meaning...
Oral sources are credible but with a different credibility. The importance of
oral testimony may lie not in its adherence to fact, but rather in its departure
from it, as imagination, symbolism, and desire emerge.
